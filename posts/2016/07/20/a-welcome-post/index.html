<p>…my web-log, I mean. A medium to make record of my deeds, mistakes, and
triumphs as a programmer.</p>

<p>This has been a <em>long</em> time coming. About a decade long. I made a few homepages
back in my high school days, and although I do mostly web application
development this days, but I never had a real site for myself.</p>

<p>The purpose of this web-log–or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog" title="Definition of blog">blog</a>” as some of you cool kids say–is
multifold.</p>

<p>It definitely will have the usual “braindump” aspect as so <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=braindump+blog">many other
tinkers</a> have done. I come across
many problems. Most of them aren’t interesting nor really relevant. They’re
just part of the accidental complexity: some infrastructure nuances or tool
version incompatibilities. They shouldn’t exist at all.  But since they gonna
be there the next time too, and I already spent a disproportional amount of
time solving them, I might as well write them down so I don’t have to remember.
If this helps a fellow programmer all the better.</p>

<p>You know the saying: <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=the+best+way+to+Learn+is+to+Teach">the best way to Learn is to
Teach</a>. I figured
the second best thing to teaching is writing about something. So I intend to have
articles which analyze and synthesize a topic.</p>

<p>I’m not a native English speaker. So this will be a great opportunity to hone
my language skills too. Maybe my inchoate mumbling will transcend into clear
sentences.</p>

<p>I’ve got the advise from colleges and writers to start a blog as a
career-booster. As much as I’m uncomfortable with the whole <em>be-your-own-brand</em>
and <em>market-yourself-to-success</em> notion, I have to admit it has real value to
it’s core–and the industry just loves it. So I try to work on this angle as
well.</p>

<p>I make this blog in <a href="http://nanoc.ws/" title="Nanoc: a static-site generator written in Ruby">Nanoc</a>. Because I always liked the idea of static
site generators.  And because I already know and use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/" title="Jekyll - Simple, blog-aware, static sites">Jekyll</a>–I wanted
to learn something new. At the time of writing this the site is rather minimal.
This is intentional. I only allow myself to program auxiliary features or tweak
on the design when I also write some content.  Otherwise I might end up
polishing and rewriting a hollow shell that never gets published.  This welcome
post has earned me the bare minimum of a Nanoc blog. I might have a few posts
about how I do it in Nanoc if it deems worthy enough.</p>

<p>And finally maybe I always wanted to have a blog. And subconsciously it might
have nagged me ever since. Now I can cross out that on my list too :)</p>

<p>Happy reading,<br />
